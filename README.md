## Introduction

Students' Performance could be a good factor in predicting the economical level of different institutions.
The goal of this work is to track students' performance considering a set of external factors that could have both an effect of enhancing or of downgrading it.
The elements of the database Student Performance Data Set could be modeled in such a way to obtain predictions upon the final grade of the student. Furthermore, it could predict how certain external factors would influence a student's performance or what would be a perfect combination of those factors that could yield an ideal performance.

The authors propose a new way of predicting students’ success based on the new concept of online education systems. Web-based systems hold consistent data about their users, giving the opportunity to apply data mining methods. The paper presents a classification of students in order to predict their success rate, using features extracted from logged data in a web-based system that is educationally inclined. It presents steps of designing, implementing, and evaluating classifiers on an online course dataset. A key aspect is that combining multiple classifiers leads to a significant improvement in classification performance. The use of a genetic algorithm (GA) resulted in having specific weights for the proposed features that improved prediction accuracy with about 10 to 12%  compared to a non-GA classifier. The aim is to identify at- risk students early, especially in large classes, so that they can be advised efficiently.

The present work approaches the study of students' achievements in secondary education using BI/DM techniques on real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features). The data was modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks, together with four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades). The results indicate the importance of some features (e. G. past evaluations, number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption) in improving the overall prediction. As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.
